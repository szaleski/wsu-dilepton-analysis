!prefix for the files to add to the TChain, for xrootd files, use a redirector
PathPrefix = root://cmsxrootd.fnal.gov//
!number of steps to run in the bias injection, step size will be +/- MaxKBias/NBiasBins
NBiasBins = 100
!maximum injected bias to run for the study
MaxKBias = 0.01
!minimum pT cut on the muon
MinPtCut = 100.
!how to decide which is the denominator, and which is scaled (+/-), scale observed to reference, and reference is denominator
Arbitration = positive
!which track algorithm to use: TuneP Tracker DYT Picky TPFMS
TrackAlgo = TuneP
!run study using upper/lower/both cosmic muon legs
MuonLeg = up
